Good choices in group awareness, participation and coordination are critical to successful collaborative writing outcomes.[2] The typing might be organized by dividing the writing into sub-tasks assigned to each group member, with the first part of the tasks done before the next parts, or they might work together on each task.[3][4] The writing is planned, written, and revised, and more than one person is involved in at least one of those steps.[5] Usually, discussions about the document's structure and context involve the entire group.[6][7]
